## Translation process

The following details about the translation process apply to multiple projects in the [Nano CrowdIn](https://nano.crowdin.com) setup including:

- [Nano.org](https://nano.crowdin.com/nano-org) translations
- Nano Articles translations

### Translation steps

The translations system is open to the public. Anyone can [sign up for an account at CrowdIn](https://nano.crowdin.com/u/signup) and assist with the crowdsourcing step by collaborating with other translators and suggesting translations. As these suggestions are put forward, they remain unpublished until they are approved.

Only individuals who have receive proper permissions in CrowdIn from the Nano Foundation can approve translations for final publishing. For anyone interested in volunteering as a proofreader for a language, please contact us at [info@nano.org](mailto:info@nano.org). We are most interested in proofreaders for the following languages for [Nano.org](https://nano.crowdin.com/nano-org) translations:

- Chinese (Simplified) (zh)
- Hindi (hi)
- Persian (fa)
- Swedish (sv)
- Russian (ru)
- Latvian (lv)

#### Initial translations

For those helping with the initial crowdsourcing step of the process, follow these steps:

1.[Sign up for an account at CrowdIn](https://nano.crowdin.com/u/signup)
1. Go to the project you wish to participate in within the [Nano CrowdIn](https://nano.crowdin.com) site, for example [Nano.org](https://nano.crowdin.com/nano-org) translations
1. Click on the language you wish to help with
1. Click **Translate All* button on top, this will bring you to the translation editor screen
1. On this screen you can type in your own translations or select other possible translations and save for further review by proofreaders, collaborating with other translators in the comment section is also encouraged

For more details about this translation editor screen, see the [CrowdIn documentation](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/getting-started-for-volunteers/#work-in-the-editor).

Once you save your translation suggestion it will become available for proofreaders to approve for final publishing. All your help here is greatly appreciated by the whole nano community!

#### Approvals

For anyone with proofreading permissions for a language, you have additional abilities available. Follow these steps to do approvals:

1. From the translation editor screen noted above, click on the left menu and go to **Workflow** > **Proofreading**
1. The list of translations here is filtered to only unapproved ones by default, and approvals can be done individually or selected in bulk and approved by clicking the checkmark

Overall translation progress for each language can be seen on the project home with blue % being translated progress (including machine translations in some cases) and green % being overall approved progress.

## Publishing translations

Depending on the project, different rules may apply for when and how publishing is done.

### Nano.org translations

Before publishing a new language to Nano.org, the Nano Foundation will look for translations to be 100% complete and 100% approved by a proofreader (this means the language will be 100% green on the [Nano.org](https://nano.crowdin.com/nano-org) project).

Once that is done, a website release must be done by the Nano Foundation to pull the translations from CrowdIn and push them to the website. This process can take days or weeks depending on the release schedule.
